4.4: The Do Loop – Practice

You will upload today’s assignment to GitHub. Check remind for the link. Name problem #1 doWhileDice.java. Name problem #2 doWhileCoffeeShop.java. Upload both java programs. Deadline Friday 6pm.

1.	Dice doubles program – write a program that simulates a dice roll by picking a random number from 1-6 and then picking a second random number from 1-6. Add the two values together, and display the total.

Write your program so that it keeps rolling until you get doubles (the same number on both dice). There will be no user input, this will happen very quickly.

Use a do-while loop.

Your output should look something like this:

HERE COME THE DICE!

Roll #1: 2
Roll #2: 5
The total is 8!

Roll #1: 6
Roll #2: 1
The total is 7!

Roll #1: 2
Roll #2: 5
The total is 7!

Roll #1: 1
Roll #2: 1
The total is 2!
YOU ROLLED DOUBLES!!


 
2.	You own a coffee shop and need to control the number of people who can be in a coffee shop at the same time. Groups of people can always leave the shop, but a group cannot enter the shop if they would make the number of people in the shop exceed the maximum of 100 occupants. Write a program that reads the sizes of the groups that arrive or depart. Use negative numbers for departures. After each input, display the current number of occupants. As soon as the coffee shop holds the maximum number of people (100), report that the shop is full and exit the program. Use a do-while loop.

Sample output:
Size of group entering: 6
Welcome in!
~Currently 6 in the coffee shop
Size of group entering: 89
Welcome in!
~Currently 95 in the coffee shop
Size of group entering: -4
Welcome in!
~Currently 91 in the coffee shop
Size of group entering: 2
Welcome in!
~Currently 93 in the coffee shop
Size of group entering: -4
Welcome in!
~Currently 89 in the coffee shop
Size of group entering: -54
Welcome in!
~Currently 35 in the coffee shop
Size of group entering: 46
Welcome in!
~Currently 81 in the coffee shop
Size of group entering: 34
Group exceeds coffee shop capacity.
~Currently  81 in the coffee shop
Size of group entering: 19
Welcome in!
~Currently 100 in the coffee shop
Coffee shop is full!
